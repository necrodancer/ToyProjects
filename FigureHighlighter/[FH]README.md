# FigureHighlighter : Sliding images darker except for inside of a bounding box.
<h2>Blueprint</h2>
This program is for highlighting specific area remaining the area but darkening out of the area.<br>
For example, you have a figure of a model. And you want to explain parts of the model sequentially.<br>
In that situation you can highlight a local area to focus on by using this program.<br>
This is the blueprint of FigureHighlighter.<br>
<h2>Other purposes</h2>
To enhance my programming skill, have a habit to program everyday, and accumulate my own project experience.

# Approaches
1. MFC + OpenCV<br>
2. Qt + OpenCV<br>
3. TKinter + OpenCV<br>
4. Web page + OpenCV<br>
# Plan
1. Choose one approach of from Approaches 1. to Approaches 4..<br>
2. Choose programming language; C++, Python, or Javascript.<br>
3. Implement the function of image sliding for a single local area.<br>
4. Combine the function into Plan 1..<br>
5. Enhance the sliding function for multi-area.<br>
